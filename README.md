"# NehaThakur_Model_V1" 
Machine Learning:Model used are two for training  and then Evaluation

The project is demonstrating a complete flow by first loading libraries, data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation of two machine learning algorithms. 

## Project Structure: two models are created

- `NehaThakur_Model_V1.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing initial model training and evaluation of logistic regression .
- `NehaThakur_Model_V2.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing additional models and evaluations using SVM.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Libraries and Tools Used are as following

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `sklearn`

## Workflow of the code

1. **Load the Data**: first the data is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. **Preprocess the Data**: drop the unwanted data
3. **Split the Data**: Spliting of the  data into training and testing sets.
4. **Train the Models**: Train various machine learning models based on various features and variables.
5. **Evaluate the Models**: the models are compared based on accuracy, precision, recall.
